PDF Analysis for 54-11-067 Report:

TABLE A shows:
- Vessel Shell: Nominal 0.625, Actual 0.662, Min Required 0.650, Design MAWP 250.00, Calculated MAWP 255.7, Remaining Life 12.00
- East Head: Nominal 0.500, Actual 0.630, Min Required 0.646, Design MAWP 250.00, Calculated MAWP 242.2, Remaining Life 0.00
- West Head: All values are "-" (dashes) except Design MAWP 250.00 and Remaining Life >20

This indicates:
1. West Head component calculation exists in database but has no TML data
2. The recalculate function is creating West Head but with no thickness values
3. Need to check if TML readings have West Head data or if PDF import is not extracting it
