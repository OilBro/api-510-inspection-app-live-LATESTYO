TML Analysis for 54-11-067:

KEY FINDING: West Head TMLs have location="West Head" but component="Head" (not "West Head")

Example West Head TML:
  component="Head", componentType="Head", location="West Head"

The current detection logic looks at component and componentType fields, but West Head is only identified by the location field.

SOLUTION: Update head detection to also check the location field for "West Head" pattern.

Current detection (fails for West Head):
  compType.includes('west') || comp.includes('west')

Should also check:
  location.includes('west')
